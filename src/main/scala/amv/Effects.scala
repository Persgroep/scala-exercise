    1. Is Future an Effect? Why?

    2. Create an Effect of Type MyIO which takes an unsaferun from
    anything to a possible value of Type A if the computation is successful
    MyIO[A](unsafeRun: () => A)
    implement map and flatmap for MyIO

      create some IO which
   *  1. measure the current time of the system
   *  2. measure the duration of a computation
   *    - use exercise 1
   *    - use map/flatMap combinations of MyIO

    3. Enhance MyIO Data type
      - Introducing an Error channel
      - Add a Possible Type Argument to our IO
